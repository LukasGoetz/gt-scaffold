## Presentation
- Motivation
  - only brief reminder about assembly problem
- Methods
  - in-depth review of scaffolding step (NP something)
    - intuition about single subproblems, pseudocode not necessary
    - illustrations, e.g. subgraph from dot files
- Results
  - compare gt scaffold and sga
    - time / memory (cluster, 8 GB)
      - script/rdj-spacepeak.sh <binary>
      - bookkeeping in sga -v?
    - complete genomes
      - S. cerevisiae (reason: small?)
      - C. elegans (reason: assembly competitions? sga paper)
- Discussion / Conclusion
  - evaluate reasons for "another" implementation of scaffolding algorithm
    - fewer depencencies
    - potential future ideas / implementations
