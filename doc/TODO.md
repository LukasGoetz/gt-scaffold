## TODO
- output: convert scaffolds to fasta [Dorle]
  - traverse string graph
  - quast evaluation [Stefan]
- parser: tranform asqg format to readjoiner-compatible format [Dorle]
- parser / new module: generate DistEst file from .bam [Lukas]
  - look into abyss estimation (paper)
- parser: parse astat from readjoiner contig file [Lukas / Stefan]
  - readjoiner: -astat flag
  (- evaluate astat computation)

## OBSTACLES
- main: allow min contig length as parameter? [Stefan]
- algorithms: implement removeMultiEdgeScaffold function [Dorle]
- [insert line with standard deviation]
- mark all edges of end vertex of inconsistent edge in twin direction ?
  (ScaffoldVisitors.cpp: ScaffoldLinkValidator::visit: line 188)
  (...algorithms.c: ...filter: line 314)
- mark vertex as repeat if copy number below cutoff ?
  (ScaffoldVisitors.cpp: ScaffoldAStatisticVisitor::visit: line 86)
  (...algorithms.c: ...mark_repeats: line 83)

## DONE
- ported test to gt testsuite [Stefan]
- finalize presentation [Dorle / Lukas / Stefan]
- N50 [Stefan]
  - verify SGA: gt seqstat -contigs <fasta>
  - own: extended/assembly_stats_calculator.h

--

- test: refactor basic module [Stefan]
- test: modularized everything [Stefan]
- removed attribute index of vertices, adapted graph functions [Lukas]
- added test function for distance parser [Lukas]
- test: parser scenarios (e.g. negative contig length, wrong input) [Lukas]
- implement new script to filter DistEst-file [Dorle]
- extend graph_print-function to print the dir-information as arrowhead and tail [Dorle]
- implement set_vertex_status(v, status) and set_edge_status(e, status)
   to correctly mark all vertices and edges [Dorle]
- algorithms: mark single contigs as scaffolds [Dorle]
- graph: print scaffold only [Dorle]
